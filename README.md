# Disco Elysium Accessibility Mod

An accessibility mod for the RPG game **Disco Elysium: The Final Cut**, adding screen reader support and keyboard navigation to the game.

## About

This mod uses MelonLoader and Harmony to inject accessibility features into Disco Elysium, making the game playable for blind and visually impaired players. It provides screen reader announcements, keyboard-based navigation, and enhanced UI accessibility.

You can find the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/) or [Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/game/disco_elysium_the_final_cut).

## Installation

1. **Install Disco Elysium** (tested with the Steam version)
2. **Install MelonLoader** from [melonwiki.xyz](https://melonwiki.xyz/)
   - Run the installer and point it at your Disco Elysium folder
   - You might need to use NVDA object navigation to interact with the installer
3. **Extract the mod release package** into your Disco Elysium folder
   - `AccessibilityMod.dll` goes into the `Mods` folder
   - `Tolk.dll` and `nvdaControllerClient64.dll` go into the main Disco Elysium folder
   - `AccessibilityMod_Waypoints.cfg` goes into the `UserData` folder (contains community-contributed waypoints for the first area)

## How to Use

Launch Disco Elysium and the game will, after a few moments, start talking. It should read menu items as you navigate up and down the main menu. A controller is recommended for movement, though arrow keys will work.

## Features

- **Screen Reader Support**: Works with NVDA, JAWS, and includes SAPI fallback
- **Braille Display Support**: Automatically outputs to braille displays
- **Smart Object Categorization**: NPCs, locations, containers, and more
- **Waypoint System**: Create, name, and navigate to custom waypoints with persistent storage
- **Dialog Reading**: Multiple reading modes with language support
- **Inventory Navigation**: Full keyboard navigation of inventory screens

## Usage Notes

- The system works in tandem with the right stick for interaction
- Once you get close to an object using auto-walk (`,`), use the game's built-in controls to highlight and select what you want to interact with
- The mod prioritizes objects on the same level as your character (you may need to look for stairs)
- Object names are cleaned up from internal game names, but some may still seem unusual
- Dialog reading respects the game's language settings

## Current Limitations

- Character sheet reading is not 100% reliable, though gameplay-essential features work
- Some internal game object names may appear in announcements
- Auto-walking brings you close to objects but won't interact with them automatically
